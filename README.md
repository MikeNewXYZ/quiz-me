### ðŸŽ¨ How did I make the animated background?

[![js animated background](./assets/js-animated-background.png)](./components/background/background.js)
The background itself is made using a repeating linear gradient. It is animated using the requestAnimationFrame method, which calls its callback ever frame tick, to move the background position.

## ðŸ¤– How are the flashcards generated?

[![create quiz](./assets/create-quiz.png)](./lib/createQuiz.js)
The quiz is generated using ChatGPT, specifically using the "GPT 3.5 Turbo" model, using the OpenAI API. It simply takes in instructions shown above and using that outputs a response in JSON. The response should contain an array of questions.

## ðŸ“¹ How do I get the YouTube transcript?

I get the transcript from a YouTube video using a cheeky method. If I were to use the offical YouTube API I would need to get permission from the video creator, luckily theres a library called [youtube-transcript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/youtube-transcript) which does some wizardry.
